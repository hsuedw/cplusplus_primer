Explain what happens in the following code:

    int *q = new int(42), *r = new int(100);
    r = q;
    auto q2 = make_shared<int>(42), r2 = make_shared<int>(100);
    r2 = q2;

In the first line, we dynamically allocated two pieces of memory. Both of them
are for int objects. Therefore, q points to a piece of memory initialized to 42
and r points to the other piece of memory initialized to 100;
In the second line, r is assigned to the memory address to which q points so the
memory holding 100 is lost and leads to memroy leak.
In the thrid line, we use smart point to manage dynamically allocated memory. q2
points to a piece of memory holding 42 and r2 points to the other piece of
memory holding 100.
In the forth line, r2 points to the memory q2 points. Therefore, the memory 
which originally pointed by r2 will be automatically freed.
