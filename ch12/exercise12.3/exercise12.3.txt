Does this class need const versions of push_back and pop_back? If so, add them.
If not, why aren't they needed?

I don't think we need const versions of push_back and pop_back.
The purpose that we define and implement push_back and pop_back is to add and
remove the element at the end of the dynamically allocated vector object which
is pointed by the shared pointer data.
For a const StrBlob object, any change to the const object is not allowed.
Therefore, the const versions of push_back and pop_back are not needed.
