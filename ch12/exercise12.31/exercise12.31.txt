What difference(s) would it make if we used a vector instead of a set to hold
the line members? Which approach is better? Why?

In this case, set is better than vector.
One of the requirement is that if a word occurs more than once on the same 
line, we'll display that line only once.
If we use set and try to insert a duplicated line number, it won't be inserted.
If we use vector, we need to do a linear search and make sure the line number 
is not duplicated, then we can add it in the vector. This will make the
performance poor.
