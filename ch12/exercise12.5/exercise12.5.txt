We did not make the constructor that takes an initializer_list explicit. Discuss
the pros and cons of this design choice.

The pros and cons greatly depend on the intention of the programmer. If the
constructor taking an initializer_list is declared as explicit, the implicit
conversion from an initializer_list to a StrBlob object. It also means we can
only use direct initialization instead of copy initialization.
Therefore, the pros and cons for implicit conversion are listed as following.
1. pros
   - The programmer can use copy initializaton to initialize a StrBlob object.
     ex: StrBlob obj = { "John", "Mary", "George" };
   - The programmer can use direct initialization to initialize a StrBlob
     object.
     ex: StrBlob obj({ "John", "Mary", "George" });
   - The programmer can use assigment to assign an initializer list to a StrBlob
     object.
     ex: StrBlob b4;
         b4 = { "Angus", "Bruce", "Jack" };
   - The programmer can pass an initializer list to a function that takes a
     parameter whose type is StrBlob.
2. cons
   - The programmer may ignore the implicit conversion and the implicit
     conversion doen't make sense in the program. This could lead to potential
     bugs.
