We could have written StrBlobPtr's deref member as follows:
    std::string& deref() const
    { return (*check(curr, "dereference past end"))[curr]; }
Which version do you think is better and why?

Both versions are correct. The original version is clear to read and easy to
understand. The new version is succinct but difficult to understand.
I personally prefer the original version.
