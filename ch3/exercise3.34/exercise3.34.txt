Given that p1 and p2 point to elements in the same array, what does the following code do? Are there values of p1 or p2 that make this code illegal?

    p1 += p2 - p1;

The code 'p1 += p2 - p1;' is equivalent to 'p1 = p1 + (p2 - p1);'. Then, we can write the codt to 'p1 = p2;'. Therefore, the programmer intends to make p1 point to the object to which p2 points.
However, someone might think that 'p1 = p1 + p2 - p1' is equivalent to the original code. Actually, they are not equivalent. In 'p1 = p1 + p2 - p1', 'p1 + p2'  is evaluated first. We must be aware that addition for two pointers is not a legal operation.
We can read exercise3.34-a.cpp to verify the arguments.

On the other hand, if p1 and p2 point to elements belonging to different arrays, the original code is still legal. The result is that p1 points to the object to which p2 points. We can read exercise3.34-b.cpp to verify this idea.
