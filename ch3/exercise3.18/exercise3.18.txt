Is the following program legal? If not, how might you fix it?

    vector<int> ivec;
    ivec[0] = 42;

Answer:
This program is illegal, because ivec is declared as an empty vector and the second line attempts to assign a value to the first element, which doesn't exist. The second line will cause buffer overflow error in run time. It is possible that the compiler might not detecte such error.
I will use the push_back() member function to fix this issue. Therefore, one of the possible solutions could be the program shown as following.

    vector<int> ivec;
    ivec.push_back(42);
