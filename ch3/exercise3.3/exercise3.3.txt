The string input operator reads and discards any leading whitespace (e.g., spaces, newlines, tabs). It then reads characters until the next white space character is encountered.
The getline function takes an input stream and a string. This function reads the given stream up to and including the first newline and stores what it read - not including the newline - int its string argumen. After, getline sees a newline, even if it is the first character in the input, it stops reading and returns. If the first character in the input is a newline, then the resulting string is the empty string.
