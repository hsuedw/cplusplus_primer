* There the three ways to define a vector and give each 10 elements, each with teh value 42.
    (1) vector<int> v1(10, 42);
    (2) vector<int> v2 = {42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42};
    (3) vector<int> v2{42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42};

  I personally prefer the first way, because it is an easy way to define a vector in this case.
