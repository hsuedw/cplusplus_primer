Waht does the following program do? Is it valid? If not, why not?

    string s;
    cout << s[0] << endl;

This program prints the first character of the string s.
However, this program is invalid, because s is defined as an empty string
and this program access s with an invalid index.
The result is undefined to access a string with an index out of range.

In my computer, exercise3.9.cpp works fine and doesn't break anything.
Howerver, it doesn't mean it works fine on another platform as well.
