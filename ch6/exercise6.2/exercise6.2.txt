Indicate which of the following functions are in error and why. Suggest how
you might correct the problems.

(a) int f() {
        string s;
        // ...
        return s;
    }

    The object type on the return statement doesn't match the return type of 
    the function. I would like to fix the code as the following way.

    string f() {
        string s;
        // ...
        return s;
    }

(b) f2 (int i) { /* ... */  }

    This function doesn't return a value, so the return type should be void.

    void f2 (int i) { /* ... */  }

(c) int calc(int v1, int v1) /* ... */ }

    The name for each parameter shouldn't be the same. Moreover, the left curly
    brace of the function body is missing.

    int calc(int v1, int v2) { /* ... */ }

(d) double square(double x) return x * x;

    The statements in function must be embraced by a pair of curly braces.

    double square(double x) { return x * x; }
