Given the declarations for f from page 242, list the viable functions, if any
for each of the following calls. Indicate which functions the best match, or if
the call is illegal whether there is no match or why the call is ambiguous.

    (a) f(2.56, 42)
    (b) f(42)
    (c) f(42, 0)
    (d) f(2.56, 3.14)

(a) The viable functions for f(2.56, 42) are void f(int, int) and 
    void f(double, double = 3.14). Because there is no best match, the call is
    ambiguous.

(b) The viable functions for f(42) are void f(int) and 
    void f(double, double = 3.14). The best match is void f(int).

(c) The viable function for f(42, 0) is void f(int, int). It is also the best
    match for this call.

(d) The viable function for f(2.56, 3.14) is void f(double, double = 3.14). It
    is also the best match for this call.
