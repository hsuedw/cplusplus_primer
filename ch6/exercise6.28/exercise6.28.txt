In the second version of error_msg that has an ErrCode parameter, what is the
type of elem in the for loop?

    void error_msg(ErrCode e, initializer_list<string> il)
    {
        cout << e.msg() << ": ";
        for (const auto &elem : il)
            cout << elem << " ";
        cout << endl;
    }

Because initializer_list is a template type, when we define an initializer_list,
we must specify the type of the elements that the list will contain. From the 
code we know that the type of the elements in il is string. Therefore, the type 
of elem in the for loop is const string&.
