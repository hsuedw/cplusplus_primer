Given the following declaratins, 

    void manip(int, int);
    double dobj;

what is the rank (section 6.6.1, p. 245) of each conversion in the following
calls?

    (a) manip('a', 'z');
    (b) manip(55.4, dobj);

(a) Because the best match is void manip(int, int), the conversion rank is
    matching through a promotion.

(b) Because the best match is void manip(int, int), the conversion rank is
    matching through an arithmetic or pointer conversion.
