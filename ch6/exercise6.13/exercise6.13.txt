Assuming T is the name of a type, explain the difference between a function
declared as void f (T) and void f (&T)

Because T can be a large class or container, the first function declaration, 
void f (T), will lead to a copy of the value of the argument to the parmeter 
when the function is called.
In the second function declaration, void f(&T), the parameter is a reference.
After the function is called, the parameter is an alias of the argument.
There is no copy involved. Any operation on the parameter (reference) is 
actually operation on the argument.
