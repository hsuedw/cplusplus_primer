When is it valid to return a reference? A reference to const?

When a function complete, its storage is freed. After a function terminates,
reference to local objects refer to memory that is no longer valid. Therefere,
never return a reference to a local object.
When the programmer doesn't want the returned reference is used to modified the
object to which it refers, a reference to const may be considered.
