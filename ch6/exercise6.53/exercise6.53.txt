Explain the effect of the second declaration in each one of the following sets
of declarations, Indicate which, if any, are illegal.

   (a) int calc(int&, int&);
       int calc(const int&, const int&);

       The two declarations for overloaded functions are legal. Because the
       const in the parameter list of the second calc is low-level const, the
       compiler can use the const-ness to distinguish to which calc is a match
       for the call.

   (b) int calc(char*, char*);
       int calc(const char*, const char*);

       The two declarations for overloaded functions are legal. Because the
       const in the parameter list of the second calc is low-level const, the
       compiler can use the const-ness to distinguish to which calc is a match
       for the call.

   (c) int calc(char*, char*);
       int calc(char* const, char* const);

       The two declarations for overloaded functions are illegal. Because the
       const in the parameter list of the second calc is high-level const, which
       will be ignore in initialization, the compiler cannot which one is a
       match for the call.
