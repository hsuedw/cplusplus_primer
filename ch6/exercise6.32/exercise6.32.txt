Indicate whether the following function is legal. If so, explain what it does;
if not, correct any errors and then explain it.

    int &get(int *arry, int index) { return arry[index]; }
    int main() {
        int ia[10];
        for (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i) 
            get(ia, i) = i;
        return 0;
    }

The code is correct.
get takes two parameters, which are an array and an index of that array. It
returns a referenct to int object. The refrence refers to the element which the
index parameter indicates.
In main, ia is an array of ten ints and the for loop iterates through each
element in ia. In each iteration, get returns a reference to each of the 
element in ia and assign it to the value of i.
Therefore, the purpose of the code is to define an array of ten ints and
sequentially assign 0~9 to each of its elements.
