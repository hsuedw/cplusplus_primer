Explain what this loop does and whether it is a good use of assert:

    string s;
    while (cin >> s && s != sought)  {}   // emptyp body
    assert(cin);

The use of assert in this code is not good.

This while loop keeps reading string from the standard input until the input
string is the string of sought. In this case, the asser macro does nothing.

This while loop also can intentionally be terminated by the user. In such case,
the cin object will be evaluate as false in a conditional expression and the
assert macro prints message and terminates the program.
