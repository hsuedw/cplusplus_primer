Explain the differences between a parameter, a local variable, and a local 
static variable. Give an example of a function in which each might be useful.

Parameters and variables defined inside a function body are referred to as
local variables. They are local to that funcion.

The objects that correspond to ordinary local variables are created when the 
function's control path passes through the variable's definition. They are
destroyed when contol passes through the end of the block in which the variable 
is defined.

Objects that exist only while a block is executing are known as automatic 
objects. After execution exits a block, the values of the automatic objects 
created in that block are undefined.

Parameters are automatic objects. Storage fro the parameters is allocated 
when the function begins. Parameters are defined in the scope of the function 
body. Hence they are destroyed when the function terminates.

Automatic objects corresponding to the function's parameters are initialized
by the arguments passed to the function. Automatic objects corresponding to 
local variables are initialized if their definition contains an initializer. 
Otherwise, they are default initialized, which means that uninitialized local 
variables of built-in type have undefined values.

Each local static object is initialized before the first time execution passes 
through the object's definition. Local statics are not destroyed when a 
function ends; they aredestroyed when the program terminates.
