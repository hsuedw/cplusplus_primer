Write three additional declarations for the function in the previous exercise.
One should use a type alias, one should use a trailing return, and the third
should use decltype. Which form do you prefer and why?

My answer is shown as the following declarations.

1. type alias

   typedef string arrType[10];
   //using arrType = string[10];
   arrType &func2();

2. trailing return 

   auto func3() -> string (&)[10];

3. decltype

   string strList[10];
   decltype(strList) &func4();
