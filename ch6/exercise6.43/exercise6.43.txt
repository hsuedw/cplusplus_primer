Which one of the following declarations and definitions would you put in a
header? In a souce file? Explain why.
    (a) inline bool eq(CONST BigInt&, const BigInt& ) { ... }
    (b) void putValues(int *arr int size);

(a) eq is an inline function. The compiler needs the definition, not just the
    declaration, in order to expand the code. All the definitions of a given 
    inline function must match exactly. Therefore, inline functions normally
    are defined in headers.

(b) putValues is neither an inline nor a constexpr function. Therefore, its
    declaration can be put in a header while its definition can be put in a
    source file.
