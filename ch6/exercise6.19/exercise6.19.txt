Given the following declarations, determine which calls are legal and which 
are illegal. For those that are illegal, explain why.

    double calc(double);
    int count(const string &, char);
    int sum(vector<int>::iterator, vector<int>::iterator, int)
    vector<int> vec(10);
    (a) cal(23.4, 55.1);
    (b) count("abcda", 'a');
    (c) calc(66);
    (d) sum(vec.begin(), vec.end(), 3.8);

(a) This statement is illegal. The declaration of calc takes one parameter but 
    this statement gives two arguments. 

(b) This statement is legal.

(c) This statement is legal. An integral literal can be converted to a double
    object.

(d) This statement is legal. However, the third argument, which is a double 
    literal, will be converted to an int object. This will lead to information
    loss.
