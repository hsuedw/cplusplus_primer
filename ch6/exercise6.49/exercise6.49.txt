What is a candidate function? What is a viable function?

A candidate function is a function with the same name as the called function and
for which a declaration is visible at the point of the call.

Viable functions are selected from the candidate functions. To be viable, a
function must have the same number of parameters as there are arguments in the
call, and the type of each argument must match - or be convertible to - the type
of its corresponding parameter.
