In the call to factorial, why did we pass val - 1 rather than val--?

The definition of factorial is shown as following.

    int factorial(int val)
    {
        if (val > 0)
            return factorial(val - 1) * val;
         return 1;
    }

In the return statement with the if clause, val appears in both operands of the
multiplication operator. In C++, there is no guarantee for the order of
evaluation, so we don't know which operand will be evaluated first. If we passed
val-- instead of val - 1, the right operand might be evaluated after val--. This
could lead to logic error and factorial calculates wrong answers.
