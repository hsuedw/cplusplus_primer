Which, if any, of the following calls are illegal? Why? Which, if any, are legal
but unlikely to match the programmer's intent? Why?

    char *init(int ht, int wd = 80, char bckgrnd = ' ');

    (a) init();  (b) init(24, 10);  (c) init(14, '*');

(a) The call for init in (a) is illegal. Because init has one parameter having
    no default value, the call for init must provide an argument for that 
    parameter.

(b) The call for init in (b) is legal and likely to match the programmer's 
    intent. init is called as if init(24, 10, ' '), because the default value 
    of bckgrnd is ' '.

(c) The call for init in (c) is legal but unlikely to match the programmer's 
    intent. init is called as if init(14, '*', ' '). Because '*' is a char and 
    it can be converted to int. By checking ASCII table, '*' is 42 in decimal, 
    so the call can be considered as following.

        init(14, 42, ' ');

    Hence, this call passes 42 to the wd parameter.
