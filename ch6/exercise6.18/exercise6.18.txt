Write declarations for each of the following functions. When you write these 
declarations, use the name of the function to indicate what the function does.

(a) A function named compare that returns a bool and has two parameters that 
    are references to a class named matrix.

    bool compare(const matrix &, const matrix &);

(b) A function named change_val that returns a vector<int> iterator and takes
 two parameters: One is an int and the other is an iterator for a vector<int>.

     vector<int>::iterator change_val(int, vector<int>::iterator);
