When you use an initializer_list in a range for would you ever use a reference
as the loop control variable? If so, why? If not, why not?

Because initializer_list has begin and end members, we can use reference as the
loop control variable in a reange for. By doing so, we can avoid copying and
directly access the element to which the reference refers. However, because the 
elements in an initializer_list are always const values, we cannot change the 
value of an elemnent in an initializer_list through a reference.
