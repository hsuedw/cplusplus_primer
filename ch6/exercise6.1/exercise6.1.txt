What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Arguments are a comma-separated list in the call operator, which is a pair of
parentheses. The Arguments are used to initialize the function's parameters.
The first argument initializes the first parameter, the second argument 
inializes the second parameter, and so on. Although we knon which argument 
initializes which parameter, we have no guarantees about the order in which 
arguments are evaluated.
The type of each argument must match the corresponding parameter in the same
way that the type of any initializer must match the type of the object it 
initializes. We must pass exactly the same number of arguments as the function 
has parameters.
