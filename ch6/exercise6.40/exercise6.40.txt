Which, if either, of the following declarations are errors? Why?

(a) int ff(int a, int b = 0, int c = 0);
(b) char *init(int ht = 24, int wd, char bckgrnd);

The function declaration in (a) is legal, while that in (b) is illegal. The
function declaration of init has one default parameter but all the other
parameters in its right do not have default values.
