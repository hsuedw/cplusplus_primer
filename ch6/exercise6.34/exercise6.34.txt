What would happen if the stopping condition in factorial were
    if (val != 0)

Then, the code would become as following.

    int factorial(int val)
    {
        if (val != 0)
            return factorial(val - 1) * val;
         return 1;
    }

This code is correct.
When factorial is called with 0 is its argument, the condition in if will be
evaluated as false. Then, 1 will be returned to its caller. This matches the
definition of factorial, 0! = 1.
