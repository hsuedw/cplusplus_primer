When should reference parameters be references to const? What happens if we 
make a parameter a plain reference when it could be a reference to const?

When the function doesn't need to modify the object to which the reference 
parameter refers, the reference parameter should be a reference to const.i

It is a somewhat common mistake to define parameters that a function does not 
change as (plain) references. Doing so gives the function's caller the 
misleading impression that the function might change its argumen's value. 
Moreover, using a reference instead of a reference to const limits the type 
of arguments that can be used with the function. We cannot pass a const 
object, or a literal, or an object that requires conversion to a plain 
reference parameter.
