Would it be possible to define isShorter as a constexpr? If so, do so. If not,
explain why not.

isShorter cannot be defined as a constexpr function.

A constexpr function is defined like any other function but must meet certain
restrictions: The return type and the type of each parameter must be a liter
type, and the function body must contain exactly one return statement.

The definition of isShorter is shown as following.

    bool isShorter(const string &s1, const string &s2) 
    {
        return s1.size() < s2.size();
    }

Although isShorter has exactly one retrun statement, its parameters don't have
literal types. Therefore, isShorter cannot be a constexpr function.
