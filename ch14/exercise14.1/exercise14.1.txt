In what ways does an overloaded operator differ from a built-in operator? In what ways are overloaded operators the same as the built-in operators?

1. The difference between an overloaded operator and a built-in operator.

   An operator function must either be a member of class or have at least one parameter of class type.
   Because using an overloaded operator is really a function call, the guarantees of the order in which operands are evaluated does not apply to overloaded operators. In particular, the operand-evaluation guarantees of the logical AND, logical OR and comma operators are not preserved. Moreover, the overloaded versions of && or || operators do not preserve short-circuit evaluation properties of the built-in operators. Both operands are always evaluated.

2. The common ways between an overloaded operator and a build-in operator.

   An overloaded operator has the same precedence and associativity as the corresponding built-in operator.
