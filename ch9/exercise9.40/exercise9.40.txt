If the program in the previous exercise reads 256 words, what is its likey
capacity after it is resized? What if it read 512? 1,000? 1048?

If 256 words are read, the capacity will remain 1024 after it is resized.
If 512 words are read, the capacity will remain 1024 after it is resized.
If 1000 words are read, the capacity will be greater than 1500.
If 1048 words are read, the capacity will be greater than 1572.
