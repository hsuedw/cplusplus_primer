Which is the most appropriate - a vector, a deque, or a list - for the following
program tasks? Explain the rationale for your choice. If there is no rease to
prefer one or another container, explain why not.

(a) Read a fixed number of words, inserting them in the container alphabetically
    as they are entered. We'll see in the next chapter that associative
    containers are better to this problem.

    Because the number of input words is fixed, the librany array is a good
    choice. After all the data are input, we can use sort algorithm to sort
    these elements in the container.

(b) Read an unknown number of words. Always insert new words at the back. Remove
    the next value from the front.

    Because the number of input words is unknown and we need to update the
    elements at the back and front, deque and list are good choices for this 
    case.

(c) Read an unknown number of integers from a file. Sort the numbers and then
    print them to standard output.

    We can store all the integers into a vector. After all the integers are read
    and stored in the vector, we can use a sort algorithm to sort all the
    numbers. Then, we can print the sorted numbers to standard output.
