What are the types of the following four objects?

    vector<int> v1;
    const vector<int> v2;
    auto it1 = v1.begin(), it2 = v2.begin();
    auto it3 = v1.cbegin(), it4 = v2.cbegin();

it1 and it2 have different types. it3 and it4 have differet types. Thereford, we
have to fix the code as the following way.

    vector<int> v1;
    const vector<int> v2;
    auto it1 = v1.begin();
    auto it2 = v2.begin();
    auto it3 = v1.cbegin();
    auto it4 = v2.cbegin();

it1 has the type of vector<int>::iterator and it refers to the first element of
v1.

it2 has the type of vector<int>::const_iterator ant it refers to the first
element of v2;

it3 has the type of vector<int>::iterator and it refers to the last element of
v1.

it4 has the type of vector<int>::const_iterator ant it refers to the last
element of v2;
