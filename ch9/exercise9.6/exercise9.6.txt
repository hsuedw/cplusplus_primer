What is wrong with the following program? How might you correct it?

    list<int> lst1;
    list<int>::iterator iter1 = lst1.begin(),
                        iter2 = lst1.end();
    while (iter1 < iter2) /*  ...   */

The less than operator (<) is not supported by the list container.

I would like to fix the in the following way.

    list<int> lst1;
    list<int>::iterator iter1 = lst1.begin(),
                        iter2 = lst1.end();
    while (iter1 != iter2) /*  ...   */
