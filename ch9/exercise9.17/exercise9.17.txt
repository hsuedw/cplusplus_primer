Assuming c1 and c2 are containers, what (if any) constraints does the following
usage place on the types of c1 and c2?

    if (c1 < c2)

Because unordered associative containers do not support relational operators (>,
>=, <, <=), c1 and c2 cannot be unordered associative containers.
Both c1 and c2 must be the same kind of container and mus hold elements of the
same type. Otherwise, the < operator must be overloaded.
If the element type doesn't support the < operator, we cannot use the < operator
on containers (i.e. c1 and c2) holding that type.
