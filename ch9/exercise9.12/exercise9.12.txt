Explain the differences between the constructor that takes a container to copy
and the constructor that takes two iterators.

The constructor that takes a container copies all the elements to to new
container. Therefore, the new container is a copy of the orginal container.

Assume the two iterators belong to the same container and denote a valid range.
The constructor that takes the two iterators copies all the elements in the
valid range to the new container.
