Given that vec holds 25 elements, what does vec.resize(100) do? What if we next
wrote vec.resize(10)

After the statement, vec.resize(100), is executed, vec will hold 75 more
elements at the tail of the original 25 elements. The newly appended elements
are value initialized. If the type of elements hold by vec is a class type, we
must supply an initializer or the element type must have a default constructor.

After the statemet, vec.resize(10), is executed, vec will keep the first ten
elements and erase the rest 90 elements.
