What is the difference between the begin and cbegin functions?

cbegin return the const iterator referring to the first element in the
container. The programmer cannot modify the elements through this const
iterator.

begin is overloaded. There are actually two members named begin. One is a const
member that returns the contain's const_iterator type. The other is non-const
and returns the container's iterator type. When we call one of these members on
a non-const object, we get the version that returns iterator. We get a cosnt
version of the iterators only when we call these functions on a const object.
