In the program on page 354 whould it be legal to write the call to insert as
follows? If not, why not?

    iter = vi.insert(iter, *iter++);

Although the statement is legal, the order of evaluating the arguments is
impelmentation specific in compiler. If the second argument is evaluated first,
the logic of this statement will be wrong.
