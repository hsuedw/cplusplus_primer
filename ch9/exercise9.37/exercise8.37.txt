Why don't list or array have a capacity member?

Because the size of the library array is fixed and a part of its type, the size
of an object whose type is library array equals to its capacity. It is
unnecessary to have a capacity in the library array.

list is a container for doubly linked list. When inserting a new node into list,
the library can dynamically allocate memory for that newly added node. When
delete a node from list, the library can free the memory that is used by the
deleted node. It is unnecessary to have a capacity in list.
