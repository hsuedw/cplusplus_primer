Given the definitions of name and numbers on page 365, what does
numbers.find(name) return?


From page 365, I can find the definitions of numbers and name as following.

   string numbers("0123456789"), name("r2d2");

Then, the statement, numbers.find(name), cannot find "r2d2" in "0123456789", so
it will return string::npos.
