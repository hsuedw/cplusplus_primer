Explain what the following program fragment does:

    vector<string> svec;

    // The size of svec is zero, while the capacity will be 1024 empty string.
    svec.reserve(1024);

    string word;

    // The while loop will keep appending strings into svec until an EOF is
    // encountered in the standard input. If there are more than 1024 string
    // from the standard input, the capacity will be increased and the internal
    // memory for holding all the strings will be relocated to accommodate more 
    // strings.
    while (cin >> word)
        svec.push_back(word)

    // The size of svec will be one and a half of the original size. The newly
    // appended elements are empty strings. If the capacity is not enough, the
    // the library will increase the capacity and reallocate the internal memory
    // of svec.
    svec.resize(svec.size() + svec.size() / 2);
