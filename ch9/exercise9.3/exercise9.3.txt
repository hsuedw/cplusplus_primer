What are the constraints on the iterators that form iterator ranges?

1. The iterators begin and end must refer to the same container.
2. The iterator end may be equal to begin but must refer to an element before
   the one denoted by begin.
3. The iterator end can refer to the element just right the last element of the
   container.
4. It is possible to reach end by repeatedly incrementing begin.
