Assume that numbered is a class with a default constructor that generates a
unique serial number for each object, which is stored in a data member named
mysn. Assuming numbered uses the synthesized copy-control members and given the
following function:

    void f (numbered s) { cout << s.mysn << endl; }

what output does the following code produce?

    numbered a, b = a, c = b;
    f(a); f(b); f(c);

Because the default constructor of the numbered class generates a unique serial
number for each object, a has a unique serial number. However, the numbered
class uses the synthesized copy-control members, so b and c has the same serial
number with a. Therefore, all the function calls of f will print the same serial
number.
