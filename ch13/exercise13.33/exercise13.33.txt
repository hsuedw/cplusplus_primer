Why is the parameter to the save and remove members of Message a Forder&? Why
didn't we define that parameter as Folder? Or const Folder&?

If we use Folder as the type of the parameter in save and remove, the Folder
object manipulated in save and remove is a local copy of the argument. Our
change in the local Folder object won't affect the argument in the caller.

If we use const Folder& as the type of hte parameter in save and remove, we can
not change the argument referenced by the parameter because of the const
modifier.
