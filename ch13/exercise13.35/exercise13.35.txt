What would happen if Message used the synthesized versions of the copy-control
members?

If we use the synthesized version of copy constructor, the newly created Message
object won't appear in the Folder objects in which the original Message object
appears.

If we use the synthesized version of copy-assignment operator, the left-hand
side Message object won't appear in the Folders in which the right-hand side
Message object appears.

If we use the synthesized version of destructor, after the Message is destroyed,
the Folders that was saving this destroyed Message still have the pointers
refering to the destroyed Message. This is a serious bug that the program will 
access invalid memory address.
