What happens when we assign ont StrBlob to another? What about StrBlobPtrs?

Based on the code on page 456, because we don't define the copy-assignment
operator for StrBlob, the synthesized copy-assignment operator  memberwise 
copies the members of its argument (the right-hand operand) into the left-hand
operand, which is bound to the implicit this parameter. The member called data 
is a shared pointer to vector. Therefore, both StrBlob object will share the 
same vector object and the reference count will be incremented by 1.
Based on the code on page 474, because we don't define copy-assignment operator 
for StrBlobPtr, the synthesized copy-asssingment operator memberwise copies the 
members of its argument (the right-hand operand) into the left-hand operand,
which is bound to the implicit this parameter. The member called wptr is a 
weak_ptr to vector. Therefore, both StrBlobPtr object will share teh same vector 
object and the reference count will not be incremented by 1.
