Why did we use postfix increment in the call to construct inside push_back? What would happen if it used the prefix increment?

Because first_free is the pointer refers to the first free element, we can construct the new string object in the memory referred by first_free. Once the construction finished, first_free has to be moved and refers to the next element which is available for constructing the next new string object.

If we use prefix increment, the new string object will be construct to the next element instead of the element referred by first_free. Therefore, every newly added element has a raw element before it.
