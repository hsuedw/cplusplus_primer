Assume numbered has a copy constructor that generates a new serial number. Does
that change the output of the calls in the previous exercise? If so, why? What
output gets generated?

If the numbered class has a copy constructor that can generate a unique serial
number, all the three function calls of f will print different serial numbers.
Because the following code will invoke the copy constructor for b and c, b and c
have their own unique serial numbers.
    numbered a, b = a, c = b;
However, because the parameter of f is call by value, a new numbered object will
be created and the copy constructor will be invoked once f is called. Therefore,
the printed serial number will be different with the argument passed to f.
