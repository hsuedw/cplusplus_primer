What is a copy-assignment operator? When is this operator used? What does the
synthesized copy-assignment operator do? When is it synthesized?

The assignment operator is a function named operator=. The copy-assignment
operator takes an argument of the reference type of the class:
    class Foo {
    public:
        Foo &operator=(const Foo &);
        // ...
    };
Assignment operators ordinarily should return a reference to their left-hand
operand. The right-hand operand in a binary operator, such as assignment, is
passed as an explicit parameter.

A copy-assignment operator is used in assigment.
    Sales_data trans, accum;
    trans = accum; // uses the Sales_data copy-assignment operator

The compiler generates a synthesized copy-assignment operator for a class if the
class does not define its own.

A copy-assignment operator assigns each non-static member of the right-hand
object to the correcponding member of the left-hand object using the
copy-assignment operator for the type of that member.
