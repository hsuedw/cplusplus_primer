Explain why the following declaration is illegal:
    Sales_data::Sales_data(Sales_data rhs);

This the definition for the copy constructor for Sales_data. The parameret must
be a reference to Sales_data. If the parameter were not a referece, the the call
would never succeed--to call the copy constructor, we'd need to use the copy
constructor to copy the argument, due to copy the argument, we'd need to call
the copy constructor, and so on indefinitely.
