What happens when we copy a StrBlob? What about StrBlobPtrs?

Based on the code on page 456, because we don't define copy constructor for 
StrBlob, the synthesized copy constructor memberwise copies the members of 
its argument into the object being created. The member called data is a shared
pointer to vector. Therefore, both StrBlob object will share the same vector
object and the reference count will be incremented by 1.
Based on the code on page 474, because we don't define copy constructor for
StrBlobPtr, the synthesized copy constructor memberwise copies the members of 
its argument into the object being created. The member called wptr is a weak_ptr
to vector. Therefore, both StrBlobPtr object will share teh same vector object
and the reference count will not be incremented by 1.
