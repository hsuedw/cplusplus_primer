How many destructor calls occur in the following code fragment?
    bool fcn(const Sales_data *trans, Sales_data accum)
    {
        Sales_data item1(*trans), item2(accum);
	return item1.isbn != item2.isbn();
    }

After fcn is called, three Sales_data objects will be created. They are
accum, item1 and item2. Therefore, When fcn finishes, there will be three
destructor calls occur.
trans is a pointer to a Sales_data object, so when fcn finishes the object to
which pointed by trans won't be destroyed.
