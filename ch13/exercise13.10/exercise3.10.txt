What happens when a StrBlob object is destroyed? What about a StrBlobPtr?

Based on the code on page 456, because we don't define the destructor, the
compiler defines a synthesized destructor for us. When a StrBlob object is
destroyed, the synthesized destructor function body, which is empty, will be
executed. After the synthesized destructor is executed, the reference count 
of data, which is a shared_ptr, is decremented by one. Once the reference count
reaches zero, the object to which pointed by data will be destroyed. 

Based on the code on page 474, because we don't define the destructor, the
compiler defines a synthesized destructor for us. When an StrBlobPtr object is
destroyed, the synthesized destructor function body, which is empty, will be
executed. After the synthesized destructor is executed, the two members are
destroyed in following order.
1. The type of curr is std::size_t, which is a built-in type, so it doesn't have
   destructors and nothing is done to destroy curr.
2. wptr is a week_ptr, so it is a class type and has a destructor. When wptr is
   destroyed, the reference count of the shared_ptr object won't be decreased.
