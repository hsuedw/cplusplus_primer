Assuming Point is a class type with a public copy constructor, identify each use
of the copy constructor in this program fragment:

    Point global;

    // Copy initialize will happen when argument is copied to the parameter, so
    // the copy constructor will be called.
    Point foo_bar(Point arg)
    {
        // We use the = operator to copy initialize local, so the copy constructor 
	// will be called.
	// We also use the copy constructor taking global as argument to create
	// a unnamed object that is referred by heap, which is a pointer to
	// Point.
        Point local = arg, *heap = new Point(global);

	*heap = local;

	// We brace initialize the elements in pa, which is an array, so the
	// constructor will be called.
	Point pa[ 4 ] = { loca, *heap };

	// The return type is a nonrefence to Point, sot the copy constructor
	// will be called.
	return *heap;
    }
