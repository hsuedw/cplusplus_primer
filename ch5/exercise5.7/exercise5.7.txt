Correct the errors in each of the following  code fragments:

    (a) if (ival1 != ival2)
            ival1 = ival2
        else ival1 = ival2 = 0;

        The statement for the if clause doesn't have the ending semicolon.

        if (ival1 != ival2)
            ival1 = ival2;
        else ival1 = ival2 = 0;

    (b) if (ival < minval)
            minval = ival;
            occurs = 1;

        Based on the indentation, I think the code should be corrected in the 
        following way.

        if (ival < minval) {
            minval = ival;
            occurs = 1;
        }

    (c) if (int ival = get_value())
            cout << "ival = " << ival << endl;
        if (!ival)
            cout << "ival = 0\n";

        Because the scope of ival is valid within the first if clause, I 
        would like to fix the code in the following way.

        int ival;
        if (ival = get_value())
            cout << "ival = " << ival << endl;
        if (!ival)
            cout << "ival = 0\n";

    (d) if (ival = 0)
            ival = get_value();

        In the if clause, the condition is an assignment expression. ival is 
        assigned as 0, so the condition is always evaluated as false. The body 
        of the if clause will never be executed.
        I think the programmer might want to check whether the value of ival
        is 0. Therefore, I would like to fix the code in the following way.

        if (ival == 0)
            ival = get_value();
