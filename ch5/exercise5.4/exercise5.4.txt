Explain each of the following examples, and correct any problems you detect.

(a) while (string::iterator iter != s.end()) { /* ... */ }

    iter is defined on each iteration but it is not initialize, so this an
    error.
    I think the programmer wants to visit each character in s by using an
    iterator. I would like to fix the code as following.

    string::iterator iter = begin(s);
    while (iter != end(s))
    { 
        /* ... */
        ++iter;
        /* ... */
    }

(b) while (bool status = find(word)) { /* ... */ }
    if (!status) { /* ... */ }

    status is defined in the while loop and its scope is valid within that
    statement. When the program tries to use the status variable, it is out 
    of scope. The compiler should give error message for this statement.
    I would like to fix the code as following.

    bool status;
    while (status = find(word)) { /* ... */ }
    if (!status) { /* ... */ }
