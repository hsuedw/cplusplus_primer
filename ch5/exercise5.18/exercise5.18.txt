Explain each of the following loops. Correct any porblems you detect.

    (a) do 
            int v1, v2;
            cout << "Please enter two numbers to sum:";
            if (cin >> v1 >> v2)
                cout << "Sum is: " << v1 + v2 << endl;
        while (cin);

        Because there is more than one statements within the do-while loop,
        the statements must be embraced by a pair of curly braces.

        do { 
            int v1, v2;
            cout << "Please enter two numbers to sum:";
            if (cin >> v1 >> v2)
                cout << "Sum is: " << v1 + v2 << endl;
        } while (cin);

    (b) do {
            // ...
        } while (int ival = get_response());

        Because the condition is not evaluated until after the statemnet or 
        block is execuated, the do while loop does not allow variable 
        definitions inside the condition:

        int ival;
        do {
            // ...

            // update ival
            ival = get_response();

            // ...
        } while (ival);

    (c) do {
            int val = get_response();
        } while (val);

        The control variable must be defined outside of the do-while loop.

        int ival;
        do {
            // ...

            // update ival
            ival = get_response();

            // ...
        } while (ival);
