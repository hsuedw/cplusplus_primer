A block (compound statement) is a sequence of statements and declarations 
surrounded by a pair of curly braces. A block is a scope. Name introduced
inside a block are accessible only in that block.
Blocks are used when the language requires a single statement but the logic 
of our program needs more than one. For example, the body of a while or for
loop must be a single statement, yet we often need to execute more than one 
statement in the body of a loop. We do so by enclosing the statements in 
curly braces, thus turning the sequence of statements into a block.
