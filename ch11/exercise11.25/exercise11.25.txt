Constrast the following program with the one in the previous exercise

    vector<int> v;
    v[0] = 1;

The second line is a runtime error. Because v is an empty vector, the element
with index 0 doesn't exist. Accessing an non-existing element in vector leads to
a serious consequence because the subscript operator doesn't check whether the
index is valid.
