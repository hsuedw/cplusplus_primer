Give an example of when each of list, vector, deque, map and set might be most
useful.

A list may be used when we need to insert or delete at any position aside from
begining and end.

A vector is usually used when we need random access and append elements.

A dequeue should be used when we need to add/delete element at the begining and
end of a sequence.

A map may be used when the elements are key-value pairs and the key is not
necessary to be integers.

A set is used when we need to check whethr a value exists.
