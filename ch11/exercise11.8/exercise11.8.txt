Write a program that stores the excluded words in a vector instead of in a set.
What are the advantages to using a set?

In a vector, if all the words are sorted, we can use binary search to find a
specfic word. The time complexity for seaching can be O(logn). If the words are
not sorted, we can use linear search to find a specific word. The time
complexity for searching can be O(n).

In a set, if it is implement by using self-balancing BST (ex: red-black tree,
AVL), the time complexity for searching a word can be O(logn). If set is
implemented by using hast table, the best searching time complexity could be
O(1) while the worst could be O(n), which depends on the implementation of hash
function and the pattern of the input data.
