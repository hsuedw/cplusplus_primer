Could we define a map from vector<int>::iterator to int? What about from
list<int>::itertor to int? In each case, if not, why not?

The specified operation must define a strict weak ordering over the key type. We
can think of a strick weak ordering as "less than".
Because we must use random-access iterators to access vector, the less-than
operator (<) is required. Therefore, we can define a map from
vector<int>::iterator to int.
Because we use bidirectional iterators to access list, the less-than operator is
not required. Therefore, we cannot define a map from list<int>::iterator to int.
