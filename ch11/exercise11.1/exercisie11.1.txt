Decribe the differences between a map and a vector.

A vector object uses integers as index to find the element at a specific
position (index). The vector elements are stored in a continuous memory block.

For a map object, the key (index) is not necessary to be integers. We can use
string or other types to be the key to find the associated element (value) in
map. map doesn't organize its underlying container in a continuous memory bolck.
The data structure used to implement a map container may be red-black tree or
hash table.
