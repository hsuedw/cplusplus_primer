Explain the difference between a set and a list. When might you use one or the
other?

Both set and list can contain a bunch of elements.
List is a sequential container that is implemented by using doubly linked list.
The elements in a list container are accessed sequentially.
Set is an associative container that is implemented by self-balancing BST or
hash table. We can use set to check whether an element exists.
