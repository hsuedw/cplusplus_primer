Explain the meaning of the operand pos.first->second used in the output
expression of the final program in this section.

List the program as following.

    for (auto pos = authors.equal_range(search_item);
         pos.first != pos.second; ++pos.first) 
        cout << pos.first->second << endl;

Based on the code on page 434, authour is declared as following.

    multimap<string, string> authors;

Therefore, the key type of authors is string , the mapped type of authors is
string, and the value type of authors is pair<const string, string>.

pos is a pair of iterators returned by equal_range. If the key (search_item)
is present in author, pos.first is the iterator refers to the first instance 
of the key. This instance has the type of the value type of authors. Therefore, 
if the key is present in authors, pos.first->second is the title of the book.
