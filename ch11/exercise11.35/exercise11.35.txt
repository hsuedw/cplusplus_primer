In buildMap, what effect, if any, would there be from rewriting
    trans_map[key] = value.substr(1);
as trans_map.insert({key, value.substr(1)})?

For the original code, if key presents multiple times, the new associated string
will replace with the old associated string.
For the new code, if key presents multiple times, its associated value will 
remain the first string. Therefore, the new strings with the same key will be 
ignored.
