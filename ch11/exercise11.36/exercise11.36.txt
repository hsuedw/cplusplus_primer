Our program does no checking  on the validity of either input file. In
particular, it assumes that the rules in the transformation file are all
sensible. What would happen if a line in that file has a key, one space, and
then the end of the line? Predict the behavior and then check it against your
version of the program.

Because the size of value will be less than 1, the else branch will be executed.
Therefore, an exception will be thrown and the following message will be
printed.

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
  what():  no rule for t
Aborted (core dumped)
