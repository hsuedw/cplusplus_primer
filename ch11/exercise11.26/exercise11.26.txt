What type can be used to subscript a map? What type does the subscript operator
return? Give a concrete example -- that is, define a map and then write the
types that can be used to subscript the map and the type that would be returned
from the subscript operator.

The key type can be used to subscript a map.
The mapped type will be returned by the subscript operator.

For example:

    map<string, int> obj;
    string word;
    cin >> word;
    int num = obj[word];

In this example, string is the type for the subscript operator. int is the type
returned by the subscript operator.
