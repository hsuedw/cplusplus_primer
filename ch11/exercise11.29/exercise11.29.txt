What do upper_bound, lower_bound, and equal_range return when you pass them a
key that is not the container?

If the key is in the container, the iterator retuned from lower_bound eill refer
to the first instance of that key and the iterator returned by upper_bound will
refer just after the last instance of the key. If the element is not in the
container, then lower_bound and upper_bound will return equal iterators; both
will refere to the point at which the key can be inserted without disrupting the
order. Thus, calling lower_bound and upper_bound on the same key yields an
iterator range that denotes all the elements with that key.
equal_range takes a key and returns a pair of iterators. If the key is present,
then the first iterator refers to the first instance of the key and the second
iterator refers one past the last instance of the key. If no matching element is
found, then both the first and second iterators refer to the position where this
key can be inserted.
