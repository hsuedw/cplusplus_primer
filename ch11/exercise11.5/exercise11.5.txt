Explain the difference between a map and a set. When might you use one or the
other?

The elements in a map are key-value pairs. The key serves as an index into the
map, and the value represents the data associated with that index.

A set element contains only a key. A set supports efficient queries as to
whether a given key is present.

We might use a set to hold words that we want to ignore during some kind of
text processing. A dictionary would be a good use for a map. The word would be
the key, and its definition would be the value.
