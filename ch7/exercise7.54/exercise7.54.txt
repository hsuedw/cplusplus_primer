Should the members of Debug that begin with set_ be declare as constexpr? If
not, why not?

These member functions that begin with set_ should not be decleared as
constexpr, because the function body of a constexpr function must contain
exactly one return statement. In the definition of Debug, the function bodies of
the member functions that begin with set_ do not meet this criterion.
