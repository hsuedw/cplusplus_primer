Explain whether the Sales_data constructor that takes a string should be
explicit. What are the benifits of making the constructor explicit? What are the
drawbacks?

The Sales_data constructor that takes a string should be explicit. Otherwise,
the compiler may implicitly convert a string to a Sales_data object. Although
legal, this may unintentionally lead to logical error.

The benifit of making the constructor explicit is preventing a type to be 
converted to that class type.

The drawback of making the constructor expplicit is that the programmer must use
the constructor explicitly.
