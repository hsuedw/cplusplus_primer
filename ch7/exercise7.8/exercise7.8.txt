Why does read define its Sales_data parameter as a plain reference and print
define its parameter as a reference to const?

read reads data from input stream and writes them into the Sales_data object 
to which the reference parameter, item, refers. Therefore the Sales_data
parameter for read must be a plain reference.

print reads the data in the Sales_data object to which the reference parameter,
item, refers and writes them to the output stream. Therefore, the Sales_data
parameter for print should be a reference to const.
