What would happen if we gave Screen a size member defined as follows? Fix any
problems you identify.

    pos Screen::size() const
    {
        return height * width;
    }

Because the return type appears before the name of the class is seen, it appears
outside the scope of class Screen. To use pos for the return type, we must
specify the class in which that type is defined.

    Screen::pos Screen::size() const
    {
        return height * width;
    }
