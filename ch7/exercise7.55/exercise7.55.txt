Is the Data class from section 7.5.5 (p. 298) a literal class? If not, why not?
If so, explain why it is literal.

The Data class from p. 298 is listed as following.

    struct Data {
        int ival;
	string s;
    };

Data is an aagregate class with two data members. The type of ival is int, which
is a literal type but the type of s is string, which is not a literal type. 
Therefore Data is not a literal class.
