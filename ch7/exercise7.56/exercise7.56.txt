What is a static class member? What are the advantages of static members? How do
they differ from ordinary members?

We say a member is associated with the class by adding the keyword static to its
declaration. Like any other member, static members can be public or private. The
type of static data member can be const, reference, array, class type and so
forth.
The static members of a class exist outside any object. Objects do not contain
data associated with static data members. Therefore, static member functions are 
not bound to any object. They do not have a this pointer. As a result, static 
member functions may not be declared as const, and we may not refer to this in 
the body of a static member. Thsi restriction applies both to explict uses of
this and to implicit uses of this by calling a nonstatic member.
The advantages of static members are listed as following.
    * Storage efficient.
    * If a static member of a class changes, each object of the class will use the new value of that static member.
    * A static data member can have incomplete type.
    * A static member (either a data member or a member function) can be used as a default argument.
