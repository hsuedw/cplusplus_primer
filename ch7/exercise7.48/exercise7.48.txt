Assuming the Sales_data constructors are not explicit, what operations happen
during the following definitions.

    string null_isbn("9-999-9999-9");
    Sales_data item1(null_isbn);
    Sales_data item2("9-999-9999-9");

What happens if the Sales_data constructors are explicit?

The first line created a string object, null_isbn, whose content is
9-999-9999-9.
In the second and third line, both called the constructor taking a const string
argument to create item1 and item2, respectively. They are diffent objects of
the same class. Their data members have the same contents.
