Would it be legal for both the constructor that takes a string and the one that
takes an istream& to have default arguments? If not, why not?

A constructor that supplies default arguments for all its parameters als defines
the default constructor. If two constructors have default arguments for their
parameters, they are both considered as default constructors. This will lead to
ambiguity.
