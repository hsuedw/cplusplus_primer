Why do you think vector defines its single-argument constructor as explicit, but
string does not?

The prototypes of string constructors taking single-argument are listed as
following.

    string(const string& str);
    string(const char *s);

In such situations, the programmers want to create string objects with another
srting object or c-style string. This matches the intention of the programmers,
so it is not necessary to declare these constructor explicit.

The single int argument for the vector constructor is used to designate the
number of the elements in the vector object. No one would intentionally want to
convert an int object to a vector object. Therefore, the vector single-argument
constructor should be declared as explicit.
