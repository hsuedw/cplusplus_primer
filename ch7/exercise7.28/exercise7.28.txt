If the return type of move, set and display was Screen rather than Screen&,
these member functions return a copy of *this. The call to set would change the
temporary copy from move. The call to display would change the temporary copy
from set. 
Because the changes would be made on the temporary objects, the result will be
    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX#XXXX 
    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 
rather than
    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX#XXXX 
    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX#XXXX
