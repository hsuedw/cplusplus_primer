The following initilaizer is in error. Identify and fix the problem.

    struct X {
        X (int i, int j): base(i), rem(base % j) {}
        int rem, base;
    };

The initialization order of data members are determined by the order of their
definition in their class. Therefore, the initialization order of the data
members are rem and base. However, in the constructor initializer, the
initialization of rem depends on base, so rem will be initialized by the
uninitialized rem.

Based on the logic of the above code, I would like to modify the constructor
initializer in the following ways. I think the first one is better, because all
the data members are initialized by the parameters.

    struct X {
        X (int i, int j): rem(i % j), base(i) {}
        int rem, base;
    };

    struct X {
        X (int i, int j): base(i), rem(base % j) {}
        int base, rem;
    };
