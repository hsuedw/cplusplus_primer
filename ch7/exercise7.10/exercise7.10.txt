What does the condition in the following if statement do?

    if (read(read(cin, data1), data2))

The inner read reads data from the input stream and store the read data in 
data1. Once a space is encountered, read returns the reference to the input 
stream object, cin. The returned reference becomes the first argument of 
the outter read. Then, the outter read reads data from the input stream and 
store the read data in data2. Once another space is encountered, the outter 
read returns the reference to the input stream object.

If the data can successfully be read from the input stream, the if statement
will be evaluated as true.
