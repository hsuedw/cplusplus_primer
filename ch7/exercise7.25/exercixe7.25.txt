Can Screen safely rely on the default versions of copy and assignment? If so,
why, If not, why not?

If a class has members of pointer type, the object of this calss cannot safely
rely on the versions of copy and assignment. Default copy and assignment will
lead to two pointers share the same object.

In our Screen class, cursor, height, width and access_ctr are built-in types.
contents is an object of string class with properly defined copy and assignment
operators. Therefore, our Screen class can safely rely on the default versions
of copy and assignment.
