Is the following declaration legal? If not, why not?

   vector<NoDefault> vec(10);

In this declaration, a vector with 10 NoDefault objects are declared. However,
the  NoDefault class has no default constructor. Because it has a constructor
with non-empty parameter list, the compiler cannot synthesis a default
constructor for it. Therefore, in the constructor of vec, the NoDefault objects
cannot be initialized. This declaration is illegal.
