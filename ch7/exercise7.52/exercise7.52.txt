Using our first version of Sales_data from section 2.6.2 (p.72), explain the
following initialization. Identify and fix any problems.

    Sales_data item = {"978-0590353403", 25, 15.99};

The definition of Sales_data on p. 72 is listed as following.

    struct Sales_data {
        std::string bookNo;
	unsigned units_sold = 0;
	double revenue = 0.0;
    };

Therefore, the declaration of item creates a Sales_data object and its data
members are initialized by the initializers in the braces. item.bookNo will be a
string with content "978-0590353403", item.units_sold will be a unsigned int
with value 25, and item.revenue is a double with value 15.99.
