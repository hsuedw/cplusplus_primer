When a parameter name is the same with one of the data members, it is necessary
to use the this pointer to refer to members.

Take the set member function in the Screen class for example, because the first
parameter has the same name with the data member, width, we have to use the this
pointer to refer to the data member.

   Screen &Screen::set(pos width, pos height, char ch)  {
       contents[width * this->width + c] = ch;
       return *this;
   }

Therefore, the advantage by using the this pointer to refer to the members is
clearity. The disadvntage is redundant for most of the time.
