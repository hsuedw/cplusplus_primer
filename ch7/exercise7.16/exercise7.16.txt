What, if any, are the constraints on where and how often an access specifier
may appear inside a class definition? What kinds of members should be defined 
after a public spcifier? What kinks should be private?

A class may contain zero or more access specifiers, and there are no
restrictions on how often an access specifier may appear. Each access specifier
specifies the access level of the succeeding members. The specified access level
remains in effect until the next access specifier or the end of the class body.

The constructors and member functions that are part of the interface should be
defined after a public specifier. The data members and the functions that are
part of the implementation should be part of the private specifier.
