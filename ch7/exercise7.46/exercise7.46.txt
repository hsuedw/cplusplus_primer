Which, if any, of the following statements are untrue? Why?
    (a) A class must provide at least one constructor.
    (b) A default constuctor is a constructor with an empty parameter list.
    (c) If there are no meaningful default values for a class, the class should
        not provide a defualt conatructor.
    (d) If a class does not define a default constructor, the compiler
        generates one that initializes each data member to the default value of
	its associated type.

(a) This statement is untrue.
    A class is not necessary to provide any constructors. If a class has no
    constructor, the complier will synthesis a default constructor for it.
(b) This statement is untrue.
    A constructor providing default arguments for all the parameters is also
    considered as a default constructor.
(c) This statement is untrue.
    If a class doesn't have the default constructor but has othe contructors,
    the compiler won't synthesis the default constructor for it. When the
    compiler need to implicitly initialize objects of this class, there will be
    no default constructor to be invoked.
(d) This statement is untrue.
    If the class has othe constructors, the compiler won't generate a default
    constructor for it.
    If the class has a member and its type is another class without the default
    constructor, the compiler cannot use its default constructor to initialize
    this member.
    If the class has members of built-in or compound type and there are no
    initializers for those members, they will have undefined values.
