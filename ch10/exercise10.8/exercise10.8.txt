We said that algorithms do not change the size of the containers over which they
operate. Why doesn't the use of back_inserter invalidate this claim?

The generic algorithms are not aware of the existence of conttainers. They only
accept iterators as arguments and use those iterators to manipulate the elements
in containers.

If the ordinary iterators are given, the generic algorithms can only use them to
sequentially or randomly visit the elements in containers. Therefore, by giving
ordinary iterators, the generic algorithms can only read elements, change the
value of elements, move around the elements. Thye cannot add or delete elements
in containers.

Because insert iterators can call container members that insert elements, the
algorithms can indirectly add elements to containers by manipulating the insert
iterators.

The generic algorithms don't directly manipulate containers. They only
manipulate iterators. If the iterators are designed to add or delete elements,
the generic algorithms can do so.
