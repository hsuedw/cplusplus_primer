Why do you think the algorithms don't change the size of containers?

The generic algorithms are not aware of the existence of containers. In stead of
directly manipulating containers, the generic algorithms use iterators to
indirectly manipulate the elements in containers. If the iterator can call
container members that can add or delete elements, the generic algorithm can
change the size of the container. Its all depends on the design of iterators.
