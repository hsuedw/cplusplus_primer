How many arguments does bind take?

The number of arguments that bind takes is mutable. The first argument for bind
is a callable object, say A, which is the function doing the actual works. bind returns
anther callable object, say B, for algorithm. If A takes m arguments, bind takes
m + 1 arguments. Therefore, the other m arguments taken by bind are for A.
Amount the m arguments, some of them are for B. For those arguments taken by A
and B, their names are _n, where n is 1, 2, etc.
