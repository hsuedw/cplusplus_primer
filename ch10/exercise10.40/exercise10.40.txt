What kinds of iterators do you think copy requires? What about reverse or
unique?

copy requires three iterators. The first two iterators specified a range of
elements in the input sequence and the third iterator specified the begining
position of the output sequence. By copying elements, we tend to read the first
element from the input sequence and write its value to the output sequence.
Then, repeat the same operations until we reach the end of the iterator range.
Therefore, the first two iterators should be input iterators and the third
iterator should be an output iterator.

Based on the prototype of reverse, it requires two bidirectional iterators.

Based on the prototype of unique, it requires two forward iterators.
