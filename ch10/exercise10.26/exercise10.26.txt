Explain the differences among the three kinks of insert iterators.

An inserter is an iterator adaptor that takes a container and yields an iterator
that adds elements to the specified container. When we assign a value through an
insert iterator, the iterator calls a container operation to add an element at a
specified position in the given container.

There are three kinds of inserters. Each differs from the others as to where
elements are inserted:

1. back_inserter creates an iterator that uses push_back.

2. front_inserter creates an iterator that uses push_front.

3. inserter creates an iterator that uses insert. This function takes a second
   argument, which must be an iterator into the given container. Elements are
   inserted ahead of the element denoted by the given iterator.
