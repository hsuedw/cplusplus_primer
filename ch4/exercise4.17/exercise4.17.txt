Explain the difference between prefix and postfix increment.

The prefix increment (decrement) operator increases (decreases) its operand and yields the changed object ast its result. The postfix increment (decrement) operator increases (decreases) the teh operand but yield a copy of the original, unchanged value as its result.
The prefix increment (decrement) operator returns the object itself as an lvalue. The postfix increment (decrement) operator returns a copy of the object's original value as an rvlaue.
