Explain the behavior of the condition in the following if:

    const char *cp = "Hello World";
    if (cp && *cp)

cp is a pointer to a c-style string and it is initialized by a string literal. We cannot modify the string to which cp points. 
Because cp points store the address of the string literal, the left hand side of && operator is evaluated as true. Because *cp is evaluated as the character 'H', the right hand side of the && operator is evaluated as true. Therefore, the if statement is evaluated as true.

In general, in the if statement, the left hand side (cp) of the && operator tests whether the cp pointer is nullptr. If it is not, the right hand side (*cp) of the && operator tests whether the string to which cp points is an empty string. For an empty string, the first character of the string is '\0'.
