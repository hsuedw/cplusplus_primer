What would happen if the while loop on page 148 that prints the elements from a vector used the prefix increment operator?

auto pbeg = v.begin();
while (pbeg != v.end() && *pbeg >= 0)
    cout << *++pbeg << endl;

Because the precedence of the prefix increment operator is higher than the dereference operator, *++pbeg is equivalent to *(++beg).
Because the prefix increment operator increases its operand and returns the increased object as its result, the first object in v will not be printed.
Moreover, the *++pbeg will dereference the object at one past the end of v. That is dereference an object that is out of the range of v. This is an error.
Also, if there is no negative value in v, the while loop will keep dereferencing all the way beyond the end of v until pbeg refers to a negative value. This is a security issue.
