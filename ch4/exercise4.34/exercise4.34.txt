Given the variable definitions in this section, explain what conversions take
place in the following expressions:

    (a) if (fval)
        In the condition, the type of fval will be converted to bool.
        If the value of fval is 0, the expression will be evaluated to false.
        Otherwiser, it will be evaluated to true.

    (b) dval = fval + ival;
        The type of fval is float and that of ival is int, so the type of ival
        will be converted to float. The type of the result of the add operator
        is float.
        In the assigment, the type of dval is double, so the type of the 
        resutl of the add operator will be converted to double.

    (c) dval + ival * cval;
        Because the multply operator (*) is higher than the add operator (+),
        ival * cval will be performed first and cval will be converted to int.
        The type of the resutl of the multiply operator is int.
        The the add operator will be performed. Because the type of dval is
        double, the type of the result of the multiply operator will be 
        converted to double. The type of the result of the add operator is 
        double.
