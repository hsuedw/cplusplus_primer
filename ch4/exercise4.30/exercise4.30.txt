Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), parenthesize the following expressions to match
the default evaluation:

    (a) sizeof x + y
        If the programmer wants to calculate the size of the result of 
        x + y, we need to add parenthesis in this expression.
        Because the precedence of the sizeof operator is higher than the 
        add operator, we need to parenthesize the expression as following.

        sizeof(x + y)

    (b) sizeof p->mem[i]
        Because the precedence of member access operator (->) and subscript 
        operator([]) is higher than the sizeof operator, we don't need to 
        put any parenthesis to this expression.

    (c) sizeof a < b
        Because the precedence of the sizeof operator is higher than the 
        less than operator (<), we need to parenthesize the expression as 
        following.

        sizeof (a < b)

    (d) sizeof f()
        The sizeof operator in this expression returns the size of the type
        of the value returned by f(). We don't need to put any parenthesis 
        in this expression.
