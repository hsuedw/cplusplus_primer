Although the following are legal, they probably do not behave as the porgrammer 
expects. Why? Rewrite the expressions as you think they should be.

(a) if (p = getptr() != 0)

    Because the precedence of assignment is lower then inequality, the if test
    is equivalent as the following.

    if (p = (getptr() != 0))

    In this way, the value of p is true or false. 

    I guess the programmer wants the return value from getptr() to be assigned
    to p. Then, check whether the value of p is 0. Therefore, I woulde like to
    modify the if test as the following.

    if ((p = getptr()) != 0)

(b) if (i = 1024)

    Because the condition in the if test is an assignment and 1024 is assigned 
    to i, the if test is always true.

    I guess the programmer wants to test if i is equal to 1024, I would like 
    to modify the code as the following.

    fix 1: if (i == 1024)
    fix 2: if (i != 1024)
    fix 3: if (i <= 1024)
    fix 4: if (i >= 1024)
