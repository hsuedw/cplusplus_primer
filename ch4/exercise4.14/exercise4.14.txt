Explain what happens in each of the if tests:

    if (42 = i)   // ERROR. Literals are rvalue.
    if (i = 42)   // This if test is always true, because the result
                  // of the assignment is 42 which will be converted
                  // true. I guess the that this if test should  be
                  // fixes as 'if (i == 42)'.
