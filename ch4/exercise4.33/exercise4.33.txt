Using Table 4.12 (p. 166) explain what the following expression does:

    someValue ? ++x, ++y : --x, --y

Because the precedence of the coditional operator (?:) is higher than
the comma operator (,), this expression is equivalent to the following.

    (someValue ? ++x, ++y : --x), --y

If the value of someValue is true, ++x and ++y will be evalutated in 
this sequence . After that, --y will be evaluated.

If the value of someValue is false, --x will be evaluated first. Then, 
--y will be evaluated.
