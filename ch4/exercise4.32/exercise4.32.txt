Explain the following loop.

    constexpr int size = 5;
    int ia[size] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    for (int *ptr = ia, ix = 0;
         ix != size && ptr != ia + size;
         ++ix, ++ptr) { /* ... */ };

ia is an array of int and it has five elements. ia is also initialized.
In the first part of the for-loop header, we define ptr and ix. ptr is 
a pointer to int and it is initialized to the first element of ia. ix is an
int and it is initialized to 0.
In the second part of the for-loop header, in each iteration of the for loop,
we test whether ix reaches the size of ia and ptr reaches one element past 
the end of ia.
In the third part of the for-loop header, both ix and ptr are incremented 
at the beginning of each for-loop.
