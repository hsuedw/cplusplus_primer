Assuming p is a pointer ot int, explain the following code;

if (p) // If p points to a valid object, this if-clause is evaluated to be true.
       // If p holds an invalid address, the result is undefined.
       // If p is assigned nullptr, this if-clause is evaluated to be false.

if (*p) // If the value of the object to which p points to is nonzero, this if-clause evaluated to be true. Otherwise, false.
