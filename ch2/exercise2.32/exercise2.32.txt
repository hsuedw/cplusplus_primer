Is the following code legal or not? If not, who might you make it legal?

int null = 0, *p = null;

This code is illegal, because p is a pointer to an int object and it must be initialized by the address of an int object or nullptr (literal).
We can fix this code as following ways.

int null = 0, *ptr = nullptr;
int null = 0, *ptr = 0;
int null = 0, *ptr = &null;
