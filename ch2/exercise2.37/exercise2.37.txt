Assignment is an example of an expression that yields a reference type. The type is a reference to the type of the left-hand operand. That is, if i is an int, then the type of the expression i = x is int&. Using that knowledge, determine the type and value of each variable in this code.

    int a = 3, b = 4;      // a and b have type int. a and b are initialized to 3 and 4, respectively.
    decltype(a) c = a;     // c has type int and it is initialized to 3, which is the value of a.
    decltype(a = b) d = a; // d is int& and it refers to a.
