A pointer is an object, while a reference is not an object.
Unlike a reference, a pointer is an object. Pointers can be assigned and copied.
A single pointer can point to several different objects over its lifetime.
Unlike a reference, a pointer need not be initialized at the time it is defined.
Like other build-in types, pointers defined at block scope have undefined value if they are not initialized.
