Why is the initialization of p legal but that of lp illegal?
int i = 42;
void *p = &i;
long *lp = &i

Because p is a void* pointer, it can hold the address of any object. Therefore, the initialization of p is legal. 
Because lp is pointer to long but i is an int object, the address of i cannot be initialized to lp.
