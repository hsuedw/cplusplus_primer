What happens when we use an uninitialized pointer is undefined. Using an uninitialized pointer almost always results in a run-time crush.
Under most compilers, when we use an uninitialized pinter, the bits in the memory in which the pointer resides are used as an address. Using an uninitialized pinter is a request to access a supposed object that supposed locatoin. There is no way to distinguish a valid address from an invalid one formed from the bits that happen to be in the memory in which the pointer was allocated.
Define a pointer only after the object to which it should point has been defined. If there is no object to bind to a pointer, then initialize the pointer to nullptr. Thta way, the probram can detect the pointer does not point to an object.
