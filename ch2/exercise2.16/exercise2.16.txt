int i = 0, &r1 = i;
double d = 0, &r2 = d;

(a) r2 = 3.14159;
    This assignment is valid.
    Because r2 is a reference bound to d whose type is double, this assignment assigns 3.14159 to d.

(b) r2 = r1;
    This assignment is valid.
    Although r2 refers to double object and r1 refers to an int object, we read the value of i, which is 0 (int), and promote it to double and assigned it to the object to which r2 bound.

(c) i = r2;
    This assignment might have waring message from the compiler.
    r2 is a refernce to d which is a double object. In this assignment, we read the value of d and assign it to i which is an int object. This may cause truncation of information.

(d) r1 = d;
    This assignment might have waring message from the compiler.
    r1 is a refernce to 1 which is an int object. In this assignment, we read the value of d and assign it to i. This may cause truncation of information.
