Explain the following definitions. Identify any that are illegal.

(a) int i, *const cp;
    This definition is illegal. It defines two variables.
    i is an int object and it is not initialized. This part is legal.
    cp is const pointer which points to an int object but it is not initialized. As other const objects, a const pointer must be initialized. This part is illegal.

(b) int *p1, *const p2;
    This definition is illegal. It defines two variables.
    p1 is a pointer which points to an int object. This part is legal.
    p2 is const pointer which points to an int object but it is not initialized. As other const objects, a const pointer must be initialized. This part is illegal.

(c) const int ic, &r = ic;
    This definition is illegal.
    ic is a const int object but it is not initialized. Therefore, this definition is illegal.

(d) const int *const p3;
    This definition is illegal.
    p3 is a const pointer which points to a const int object. However, p3 is not initialized.

(e) const int *p;
    This definition is legal.
    p is a point which points to a const int object. p can points to different const int objects.
    Although it is not initialize, the programmer can assign an address of a const int objects latter.
